And in that unforgettably sweet moment in my personal history, that one moment still more alive for me than so many of the
            other 'firsts' which followed — first pussy, first joint, first day in high school, first published book, or any other thing
            — I attained glory. Monsieur Saint-Jour beckoned me over to the gunwale, where he leaned over, reached down until his head
            nearly disappeared underwater, and emerged holding a single silt-encrusted oyster, huge and irregularly shaped, in his rough,
            claw like fist. With a snubby, rust-covered oyster knife, he popped the thing open and handed it to me, everyone watching
            now, my little brother shrinking away from this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive.
         
         
         
         
         
         I took it in my hand, tilted the shell back into my mouth as instructed by the by now beaming Monsieur Saint-Jour, and with
            one bite and a slurp, wolfed it down. It tasted of seawater . . . of brine and flesh . . . and somehow . . . of the future.
         
         
         
         
         
         Everything was different now. Everything.
         
         
         
         
         I'd not only survived — I'd enjoyed.
         
         
         
         
         This, I knew, was the magic I had until now been only dimly and spitefully aware of. I was hooked. My parents' shudders, my
            little brother's expression of unrestrained revulsion and amazement only reinforced the sense that I had, somehow, become
            a man. I had had an adventure, tasted forbidden fruit, and everything that followed in my life — the food, the long and often stupid and self-destructive
            chase for the next thing, whether it was drugs or sex or some other new sensation — would all stem from this moment.
         
         
         
         
         
         I'd learned something. Viscerally, instinctively, spiritually even in some small, precursive way, sexually — and there was
            no turning back. The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun.
         
         
         
         
         
         Food had power.
         
         
         
         
         It could inspire, astonish, shock, excite, delight and impress. It had the power to please me . . . and others. This was valuable information.
