Other examples Qushayri gave include the following:
The sign of the sincere Sufi is that he feels poor when he has wealth, is humble when he has power, and is hidden when he has fame. The sign of the false Sufi is that he acts rich towards the world when he is poor, acts powerful when he is humble, and is famous among his followers.
The foulest of all foul things is a greedy Sufi.


The basic metaphor in Sufi rhetoric, which is also prominent in other major streams of Islamic culture, is the primacy of the inner reality. Using a phrase from the Qur’an (57:3), Sufis invoked the description of God as “the first, the last, the outer, the inner.” Stressing the notion of God as the inner aspect (batin) of all things required an articulation of the relation between the inner and the outer. This was expressed most fully in a threefold rhyming structure commonly employed in oral instruction: the outward form is Islamic law (shari‘a), the inner approach is the path (tariqa), while God is the reality (haqiqa). This kind of rhetorical formula permitted Sufis to position their distinctive practices as the internalization of the external rituals of Muslim religious life. Sufism was a way to proceed from ordinary external life to find the inner reality of God.
