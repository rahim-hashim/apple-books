FOXP2 is certainly essential for speech. The 2006 analysis of the Neanderthal genome revealed that they had exactly the same type of FOXP2 gene as us, and different from chimpanzees. The differences are subtle but clearly important. There’s only two changes between the protein sequence of FOXP2 in chimps and us, and we can talk and they cannot.

### 1. Horny and mobile

We could speculate about SRGAP2, which has been linked with intelligence in some studies. We (and Neanderthals) have more copies of this gene than chimps, and probably more connections in our neurons as a result. Or we could talk about HACNS1, which is involved in hand development before birth, and is very different from the version that chimps have, whose manual dexterity is not as

sophisticated and articulated as our own. But we don’t really

understand what HACNS1 does during our own development, and therefore its role in the evolution of our handy skills. With all of the genes of Neanderthals potentially known, the truth remains that in most cases, knowing precisely how a gene is spelled is not enough to say precisely what it does.

If you are broadly of European descent, then it is almost certain that you also carry around Neanderthal DNA. This idea is called introgression—the introduction of DNA from a separate group over repeated familial backcrosses. It is a form of fusing some bits of DNA from distinct populations. Since their discovery, Neanderthals were referred to as cousins, or close relatives. It seems clear to me, using genetics as my ally, that Neanderthals categorically were also our ancestors.* This is one of the key concepts of DNA ancestry, the one that confuses all the nice clean hypothetical branches of a family tree. It’s called admixture—the mixing of genes from populations who were previously separated.

The Altai Mountains loom out of the ground near the Russian borders with China and Mongolia, and they are icy cold. This land is harsh. There’s a cave in this hinterland of Siberia, called Denisova, named after an eighteenth-century eremite called Denis who lived there.

Of the limited information that was extracted from this little loop of DNA, the number of key differences in the DNA pointed to a human whose ancestors moved out of Africa in a migration that was different from the ancestors of the Neanderthals (around half a million years ago) and our own exodus from the motherland that began at least 100,000 years ago. The number of differences in her DNA was twice as many as between us and the Neanderthals, and that number can be used to calculate the last common ancestor of these three people. Around a million years ago, somewhere in Africa, a group of humans lived who were to be separated into us, the Neanderthals, and the Denisovans.

The comparison in the new genomes showed that Denisovans and Neanderthals were more closely related to each other than either was to any living human. But the real kicker came with the revelation that Denisovan DNA was alive and well in contemporary Melanesians—the indigenous people of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and a scattering of islands off the northeast coast of Australia.

There are four living genera of hominidae, aka the great apes: Pan (chimps and bonobos), Pongo (orangutans), Gorilla (gorillas), and Homo (us). The first three have twenty-four pairs of chromosomes, whereas we have twenty-three. But all great apes, including us, share effectively all the same genes in our genomes. The discrepancy is found in our chromosome 2—the second largest single chunk of DNA we carry. It’s such a whopper because it is an end-to-end fusion of two chromosomes found in chimps, orangs, and gorillas. We know this because the genes on the two hairy ape chromosomes are effectively the same and in the same order as those found on our chromosome 2.

In 2013, David Reich, a Harvard geneticist essential to many of the stories in this book, further looked at the

Denisovan genome with a very close squint (in the form of some sophisticated and sensitive statistical analysis) and saw something difficult to explain. The Neanderthals and the Denisovans split off from the lineage that ended in us some 400,000 years ago. But if you look hard enough, the Denisovan genome looks slightly more different from ours than it should. What this implies, according to Reich and others, is that they also had admixed and interbred with another species, one for whom we have no DNA to compare. A ghost population, a group of humans who are only known by the spectral presence they left in DNA as an outcome of sex.

If you want to stick to the old definitions of a species, then it is impossible to call Neanderthals a separate species. The Denisovans have not yet been classified with the official taxonomy classifications that we adhere to. DNA is not how it is done, and a finger bone and a tooth are just not meaty enough. They were not us, and they were not Neanderthal, but we happily bred with them. This is a strange conundrum that betrays our difficulties with classifying life, and our adherence to a system that was designed to show the perfection of divine creation, organisms static in time and set in stone as they stand before us. Darwin’s great idea ruined that ideal, because he recognized that life passes through time, and changes continually. The only life forms that don’t change are dead ones.

### 2. The First European Union

in the world, Homo sapiens have been the sole human occupants of the continent and the islands of what we now call Europe for more than 30,000 years.

  Earlier people had been loitering around the continent for up to 2 million years. These included Homo erectus, a species of humans that had great success leaving the motherland of Africa and making it all around the world, as far east as Java, and all over western Europe.

Neanderthals diverged from our best-guess common ancestor, Homo heidelbergensis 500,000 to 600,000 years ago, possibly somewhere in middle Europe, and those Germans didn’t last later than 200,000 years ago. We now know that anatomically modern humans—that is, us—didn’t arrive in their lands until some 60,000 years ago, having slowly moved north and west from the Middle East and before that Africa. We know that we overlapped in time and space with the previous Europeans—the Neanderthals—and we carry their ghosts in our DNA. Coexistence in Europe probably lasted around 5,000 years

But as Europe—and indeed the rest of the world—evolved, tribes grew into fiefdoms, into states, and eventually into empires. People came from the east, and from Africa. Rome petered out, and upon that rock Christianity grew. And while those empires of Europe rose and fell, they were largely oblivious to the existence of two immense continents thousands of miles to the west. The Viking Leif Ericson was the first European to set foot on these lands, and he called it Vinland—possible meanings include meadow-land, or a reference to the wine-berries or grapevines that they found there. Centuries later and more than two thousand miles farther

south from Ericson’s first steps into the Americas, Columbus made landfall in what we call the Caribbean. There they met locals, who became generically known to the Spaniards as indios—Indians—because Columbus thought he had reached the East Indies.

### 3. These American Lands

Columbus crossed the ocean blue in 1492, and reached Central America. A few years later Amerigo Vespucci wrote a letter entitled “Mundus Novus” to his patron Lorenzo Pietro di Medici in Florence. Vespucci’s first name would be given to the continents north and south.
