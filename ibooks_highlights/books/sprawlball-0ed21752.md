### Introduction: Mapping the Geography of the NBA

What did surprise me when I first studied this chart was learning that outside of six feet there is no place on the court where shooters make more than 45 percent of their shots. I’d always thought that 50 percent was the magic field goal percentage threshold, but this graphic shows that the only place on the floor where players exceed that magic number is the tiny swath of space just in front of the basket.


From a competitive perspective, the position of the arc and the associated economic realities it imposes on the league compel teams, coaches, and players to react. The shot selection of the contemporary NBA is a reaction to this man-made economic landscape. If the NBA scoring area is a marketplace that includes a ridiculously steep subsidy incentive near its outer edge, should we be surprised to see the league’s smartest investors endlessly exploiting it? Should we be surprised that the analytics era of the NBA has begotten both a major uptick in three-point shooting and a major downtick in two-point jump shooting and post play? Should we be surprised that some of the most valuable components of current NBA rosters are guys who can shoot from 24 feet, even though they don’t do much else?

Well, that is pretty much what the NBA did back in 1979 when it declared that 24-foot jumpers were suddenly going to count for 50 percent more points that 21-foot jumpers. Yet back when the line was new, it wasn’t a big deal; few players could shoot from that far out, and the first year it was a part of the league, players took only 3 percent of their shots out beyond the arc. By 2018, that number was 34 percent and rising—and rising fast.

### The Evolution of Steph Curry

At any given time, the NBA contains about 450 of the best basketball players in the world. Pro hoops is about as close as the world gets to a plain meritocracy: if you can ball, you get paid; if you can’t, you don’t. Basketball history is littered with great players’ talented sons who never made the pros.

As a general rule, almost 85 percent of NBA triples involve an assist, and one reason bad teams find it difficult to “make threes” is that they struggle to work in concert to create them

Curry knocked down a total of 272 threes during the 2012–13 season, but a remarkable 38.6 percent, 105 of them, were unassisted.

### Pop Time

In the early part of this decade, shooters who could drain 40 percent of their threes or more got paid increasingly high salaries. But now that all 30 teams have caught on to that basic idea, the next big thing in the NBA’s catch-and-shoot arms race will have less to do with field goal percentage and more to do with speed.

### The Investor

From a defensive standpoint, fouling a three-point shooter earns you the most punitive punishment in the game. It’s the NBA’s answer to football’s 15-yard penalties for things like roughing the passer, or baseball’s free bases for balks or hit batsmen. If it’s fair to discern cultural values from modes of crime and punishment, the NBA cares more about fouling jump shooters than about anything else in the game.

as a rookie, James was average in the close-range areas and really bad in the midrange and three-point range areas. There’s no other way to put it. It would take time and effort to change that.

By averaging exactly 30 points per game, James won the NBA scoring championship in 2007–08, despite still struggling to become a truly efficient jump shooter. A quick look at his shot chart suggests that James was “inefficient” that season. There sure is a lot of blue on his chart, but on closer inspection, we can see that, while he remained a mediocre jump shooter, he was an absolute beast near the hoop. He converted 472 field goals inside within 7.5 feet of the bucket. He was also hyper-efficient near the basket: he converted 68 percent of his 699 shots in that zone, flashing the dominant blend of interior volume and efficiency that would come to be his calling card as he entered his prime.

During the 2012–13 regular season, 168 NBA players tried at least 200 shots inside of eight feet—that’s over a third of the league’s population—but only one player converted over 70 percent of those shots. James made 72 percent of over 640 close-range shots and was easily the most efficient interior scorer in the whole league. Better than Durant. Better than DeAndre Jordan. Better than Blake Griffin. It wasn’t close, but efficiency is only part of the story.
Here’s where it gets crazy: the same fella who was that interior efficiency monster was also the league’s leading scorer in this area too!


Simply put, James creates more threes for his teammates via assists than any other player in the NBA. In the five-year span beginning in 2013–14 and ending in 2017–18, James led all NBA players by assisting on 1,289 regular-season made threes. In that same time period, only one NBA player made more threes as a shooter: Stephen Curry.

Then, in arguably the biggest rule change in American sports history, the NBA added the three-point line in 1979. It was the same season the league added Magic Johnson, one of the defining players of his era, and certainly the best point guard of his time. The NBA was about to change.

Mikan’s

For me, the ball movement and tactical diversity of the 2013 and 2014 Finals were incredible. Those series featured future Hall of Famers like Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade—all phenomenal players who reached star status and won Finals MVP Awards without relying on threes  _NOTE: I wish he had given stats here, rather than hammering the same points – give us number of passes, shot charts, etc_
