THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA in contemporary politics 
forces us to ask what kind of a world and what kind 
of a society we want to live in, and in particular in 
what sense of democracy do we want this to be a 
democratic society? Let me begin by counter-posing two different conceptions of democracy. One 
conception of democracy has it that a democratic 
society is one in which the public has the means 
to participate in some meaningful way in the management of their own affairs and the means of information are open and free. If you look up democracy 
in the dictionary you'll get a definition something 
like that.
An alternative conception of democracy is that the 
public must be barred from managing of their own 
affairs and the means of information must be kept 
narrowly and rigidly controlled. That may sound like 
an odd conception of democracy, but it's important 
to understand that it is the prevailing conception. In 
fact, it has long been, not just in operation, but even 
in theory. 


State propaganda, when supported by the educated 
classes and when no deviation is permitted from it, 
can have a big effect.

Maybe there will be a popular revolution, and 
that will put us into state power; or maybe there 
won't be, in which case we'll just work for the people with real power: the business community. But 
we'll do the same thing. We'll drive the stupid 
masses toward a world that they're too dumb to 
understand for themselves.

In fact, 
going back to the business community, the last legal 
victory for labor really was 1935, the Wagner Act. 
After the war came, the unions declined as did a 
very rich working class culture that was associated 
with the unions. That was destroyed. We moved to 
a business-run society at a remarkable level. This 
is the only state-capitalist industrial society which 
doesn't have even the normal social contract that 
you find in comparable societies. Outside of South 
Africa, I guess, this is the only industrial society 
that doesn't have national health care. There's no 
general commitment to even minimal standards of 
survival for the parts of the population who can't follow those rules and gain things for themselves 
individually. Unions are virtually nonexistent. 
Other forms of popular structure are virtually 
nonexistent. There are no political parties or organizations. It's a long way toward the ideal, at least 
structurally. The media are a corporate monopoly. 
They have the same point of view. The two parties 
are two factions of the business party. Most of the 
population doesn't even bother voting because it 
looks meaningless. They're marginalized and properly distracted.

Prior to about the mid-1980s, 
when you were asleep you would just play the 
record: the Russians are coming. But he lost that one 
and he's got to make up new ones, just like the Reaganite public relations apparatus did in the 1980s. 
So it was international terrorists and narcotraffickers and crazed Arabs and Saddam Hussein, 
the new Hitler, was going to conquer the world. 
They've got to keep coming up one after another. 
You frighten the population, terrorize them, intimidate them so that they're too afraid to travel and 
cower in fear. Then you have a magnificent victory 
over Grenada, Panama, or some other defenseless 
third-world army that you can pulverize before you 
ever bother to look at them-which is just what happened. That gives relief. We were saved at the last 
minute. That's one of the ways in which you can 
keep the bewildered herd from paying attention to 
what's really going on around them, keep them 
diverted and controlled.
