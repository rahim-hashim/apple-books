### 2012

I asked George what he’d been up to, and he took a seat across from me and Evan, looked us dead in the eyes, and said, “Well, things have been pretty busy, considering we’re nearing the end of 2012.”
Hmmmmm…this sounded vaguely familiar to me. “What do you mean?”
“Well,” he said, adjusting his denim shirt, “you know the world is going to end this year, right?”
I mean, I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised. The notion that a dude who conceived of an entire science-fiction universe, complete with its own religion, mythology, technology, and hairstyles, would be a true weirdo seems obvious. But it was shocking, nonetheless.
“Uh…are you serious?” Evan asked.
“Very.” George settled in. “What do you know about the San Andreas Fault?”
At this point, I noticed Spielberg at the desk behind George rolling his eyes, like, “Here we go again.”

### Hacks

In the following weeks, I worried that the movie would be on me like a stain forever. That people would never look at me the same way again, and that maybe people just wouldn’t think I was funny anymore. What I really learned, though, was how fucking fast people forget shit and move on. Once again, an inflated sense of self-importance ultimately made the fallout not as bad as I thought it would be. By mid-January, I was in San Francisco rehearsing for the Steve Jobs movie. Kate Winslet turned to me and was like, “What was with that whole North Korea mess, dear? Did anything ever come of that?”
Me: I guess not.
