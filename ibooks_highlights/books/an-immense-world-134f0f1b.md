### Introduction: The Only True Voyage

There is a wonderful word for this sensory bubble—Umwelt. It was defined and popularized by the Baltic-German zoologist Jakob von Uexküll in 1909. Umwelt comes from the German word for “environment,” but Uexküll didn’t use it simply to refer to an animal’s surroundings. Instead, an Umwelt is specifically the part of those surroundings that an animal can sense and experience—its perceptual world.

Consider the seemingly simple question How many senses are there? Around 2,370 years ago, Aristotle wrote that there are five, in both humans and other animals—sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This tally persists today. But according to the philosopher Fiona Macpherson, there are reasons to doubt it. For a start, Aristotle missed a few in humans: proprioception, the awareness of your own body, which is distinct from touch; and equilibrioception, the sense of balance, which has links to both touch and vision.
			Other animals have senses that are even harder to categorize.

### Chapter 1: Leaking Sacks of Chemicals | Smells and Tastes

other  _NOTE: Test note_

Somewhere in Newcastle, England, lives a woman known in the scientific literature as cDa29. She’s a private person who doesn’t do interviews, and her real name isn’t publicly known. But according to psychologist Gabriele Jordan, who has worked with her extensively, cDa29 aces tests that only a tetrachromat could pass. Much like Stoddard’s hummingbirds, she can pick out one shade of green among other extremely similar ones, “like a cherry from a tree,” Jordan tells me. “For us, it’s just green among greens. Other people look and look and look and then maybe have a guess. She can spot the odd one out within milliseconds.”

Primates, for example, evolved trichromacy to better spot young leaves and ripe fruits. And once they added red to their Umwelt, they began evolving patches of bare skin that could convey messages by flushing with blood. The red faces of rhesus macaques, the red rumps of mandrills, and the comically red and bald heads of uakaris are all sexual signals made possible by trichromatic vision.

### Chapter 6: A Rough Sense | Contact and Flow

Different sections of the somatosensory cortex receive inputs from different parts of the body, and the relative size of these sections can hint at an animal’s major tactile organs. In humans, the hands, lips, and genitals are most heavily represented. In mice, it’s the whiskers; in platypuses, the bill; and in naked mole-rats, the teeth. In sea otters, the part of the somatosensory cortex that receives signals from the paws is disproportionately big compared to those of other mustelids, and even compared to those of other otters.

Fiona Remple found that the mole can identify its prey, swallow it, and begin searching for the next mouthful in an average of 230 milliseconds and as little as 120 milliseconds. That’s as fast as a human blink. Imagine that your eye starts to close at the exact moment that a foraging mole first touches an insect with its star. Before your lashes cross the midline of your eye, the mole’s brain has already recognized what it has touched and sent motor commands to reposition the star. By the time your eye is fully shut, the mole has touched the insect a second time with its supersensitive 11th rays.

The wasp—a beautiful inch-long creature with a metallic green body and orange thighs—is a parasite that raises its young on cockroaches. When a female finds a roach, she stings it twice—once in its midsection to temporarily paralyze its legs, and a second time in its brain. The second sting targets two specific clusters of neurons and delivers venom that nullifies the roach’s desire to move, turning it into a submissive zombie. In this state, the wasp can lead the roach to her lair by its antennae, like a human walking a dog. Once there, she lays an egg on it, providing her future larva with a docile source of fresh meat. This act of mind control depends on that second sting, which the wasp must deliver to exactly the right location.

Mammalian hair might have had a similar start, appearing first as touch sensors that were only later turned into insulating coats. Some hairs still retain that original tactile function. They’re called vibrissae, from the Latin word for “vibrate.” More commonly, they’re known as whiskers.

But after talking to sensory biologist Robyn Grant, I realize that a whisking mouse or rat uses its vibrissae in a way that’s far closer to what I do with my eyes. The rodent constantly scans and re-scans the area in front of it, building up an awareness of a scene. If it senses something with the long, mobile whiskers on its snout, it investigates further with the shorter, immobile whiskers on its chin and lips, which are more numerous and more sensitive.

Manatees are the only known mammals that only have vibrissae and no other kinds of hair. Aside from the whiskers on their oral disk, they have another 3,000 scattered all over their large bodies.

Most of these hairs only respond to direct contact, but some are so long and sensitive that they will also be deflected by the wind. These are called trichobothria, from the Greek words for “hair” (trichos) and “cup” (bothrium). Like a bird’s filoplumes or a fish’s neuromasts, they’re flow sensors—albeit exceptionally sensitive ones. Even air that’s moving at just an inch per minute—a breeze so gentle it could hardly be called a breeze—will deflect them.

Wood crickets have a pair of spines called cerci that protrude from their rear ends. These are covered in hundreds of hairs that are just as sensitive as a spider’s trichobothria, if not more so. These so-called filiform hairs can detect the current produced by a wasp’s wingbeats. And, as Jerome Casas has shown, they can detect the infinitesimal wind created by a charging spider

The filiform hairs of crickets and the trichobothria of spiders are almost inconceivably sensitive. They can be deflected by a fraction of the energy in a single photon—the smallest possible quantity of visible light. These hairs are a hundred times more sensitive than any visual receptor that exists, or could possibly exist. Indeed, the amount of energy needed to shift a cricket’s hairs is very close to thermal noise—the kinetic energy of jiggling molecules. Put another way, it would be almost impossible

### Chapter 9: A Silent World Shouts Back | Echoes

Sound also interacts differently with objects underwater. Generally, sound waves reflect when they encounter a change in density. In the air, they ricochet off solid surfaces. But in water, they’ll penetrate flesh (which mostly has a density similar to water’s) and bounce off internal structures like bones and air pockets. While bats can only sense the outer shapes and textures of their targets, dolphins can peer inside theirs. If a dolphin echolocates on you, it will perceive your lungs and your skeleton. It can likely sense shrapnel in war veterans and fetuses in pregnant women. It can pick out the air-filled swim bladders that allow fish, their main prey, to control their buoyancy.[*20] It can almost certainly tell different species apart based on the shape of those air bladders. And it can tell if a fish has something weird inside it, like a metal hook.

Without vision, the brain can still construct similar maps by repurposing the so-called visual cortex into an echo-processing cortex.
