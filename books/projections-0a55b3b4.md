### Chapter 1: Storehouse of Tears

Emotional crying cannot be studied well in animals. Pure emotional tears, as we experience the phenomenon, are not clearly present elsewhere even among our close relatives in the great ape family; the reason, if any, is a mystery. Tears are powerful for driving emotional connection; it is known that digitally altering tears in human face images will cause significant changes in the sympathy, and the impulse to help, elicited in viewers (much more than for altering other facial features). But we are no more social than our cousins—the chimpanzees, the bonobos—and still, using the mystery of tears, we alone cry, and cry alone.

### Chapter 2: First Break

Mice with a mutation in the circadian rhythm mechanism, in a gene called Clock, were found to show behavior that could be interpreted as manic-like, in the form of prolonged phases of extremely high movement levels. This state was found to occur at the same time as phases of higher dopamine neuron activity. Could that dopamine elevation be causal, driving frenzied movement levels in mice? Using optogenetics, the team found that increasing the activity of dopamine neurons could indeed induce the manic-like behavior; furthermore, suppressing dopamine neuron activity could reverse the manic-like state of the Clock mutant mice.

A few of these genes have turned up fairly consistently with scanning of whole human genomes in studies of type I bipolar—the kind with spontaneous and severe manias, among the most strongly heritable of psychiatric diseases. ANK3 is one such gene, which directs the production of a protein called ankyrin 3 (also known as ankyrin G), which organizes the electrical infrastructure of the initial segment of the axon—the first section of each threadlike output wire, that electrical-information transmission line connecting each brain cell with all of its receivers across the brain.
			
			These mutations, which contribute to causing bipolar disorder in some people, likely lead to insufficient ankyrin 3 production. In 2017 a mouse line was created with “knocked out”—insufficient—ankyrin 3. These initial segments of the axon were indeed poorly organized in the knockout mice as a result, in an interesting way. Inhibitory synapses that would normally be clustered at that crucial spot of the axon, acting like dampers to prevent overexcitation, were gone. And the mice showed some manic-like properties: much higher physical activity levels, in terms of both general locomotion and movements specifically directed toward overcoming stressful challenges—that is, elevated goal-directed behavior. Amazingly, this pattern could be blocked in the mice by medications, including lithium, that are highly effective for bipolar in human beings.
			As interesting as ANK3 is to psychiatrists and neuroscientists, in human beings its mutations cannot alone explain all mania, and bipolar disorder in general is far from understood. We also do not understand the association of mania with depression—that other “pole” of bipolar. Manias frequently end in deep depression, and many patients cycle from up states to down states: mania to depression, or depression to hypomania and back—but nobody knows why, and the ANK3 studies do not offer an answer.

### Chapter 6: Consummation

When a mouse is fully water-sated but the deep thirst neurons are optogenetically driven, intense water-seeking behavior results—and yet a few parts of the brain are not fooled, and seem to know the animal is not truly thirsty. These circuits listen to the drive, without buying in; their local neural activity patterns are only mildly affected. This result was one of several discoveries resulting from the kind of brainwide listening experiment I had hoped for years earlier: using long electrodes to listen in on tens of thousands of individual neurons across the brain, while optogenetically stimulating the deep thirst neurons.
			
			The first important finding from this brainwide eavesdropping, and a big surprise, was that most of the brain—including those sectors thought to be primarily sensory, or just movement related, or neither—was actively engaged in the simple state of seeking water when thirsty. Perhaps this finding revealed an important natural process by which the brain keeps all parts of itself informed on all planned movements and goals, so that even simple actions would be experienced by every part of the brain as generated from the self, and there would be no

confusion as to the source of the drive for action. This unitary quality can go awry in disorders like schizophrenia, where simple actions can feel alien—as if generated from outside the self.
			More than half of all the neurons recorded across the brain showed engagement with the task of acquiring water—both when the animal was truly needing water and also when, with optogenetics, we created a thirst-like state.

### Chapter 7: Moro

Many in the field today think an answer to this question lies in a quantity called synaptic strength—a measure of how strongly a neuron can influence another neuron, defined as the gain from broadcaster to receiver. The stronger a synapse, or functional connection, between two cells, the greater the response in the receiving cell will be to a fixed pulse of activity in the broadcasting cell. As abstract as it seems, this change in influence at the synapses could be the memory, in a real and physical sense.

### Epilogue

Modern neuroscience, however, has begun to illuminate the circuits underlying violence directed to another member of the same species—in studies that (while revealing) verge on the deeply disturbing. In a striking example of such a discovery that could not have been accomplished with prior methods, one group of researchers tried in rodents to test electrical stimulation of a tiny sliver of mammalian brain thought to modulate aggression—the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus, or VMHvl. The research team was unable to observe aggressive responses despite numerous attempts at stimulating with an electrode, likely because the VMHvl is a small structure that is closely surrounded by other structures that elicit defensive measures instead, such as freezing or fleeing; these surrounding structures or their fibers would also be activated by electrical stimulation of the VMHvl, confounding and confusing the behavioral results. But when the team next made use of the precision of optogenetics to target only VMHvl cells with an excitatory microbial opsin, stimulation of these cells with light elicited a frenzy of violent aggression toward another mouse in the cage (a smaller nonthreatening member of the same species, the same strain, that the optogenetically controlled mouse had been perfectly content to leave alone, until the moment of flipping on the laser light).
