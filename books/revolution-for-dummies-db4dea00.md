If you go back to the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, the scary image of terrorist Muslims shouting “Sharia” is nowhere to be found. So how did that fucked-up version make a comeback?
America’s archenemies, the Taliban, were on America’s good side when the CIA was funding and arming them to beat the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Even Hollywood loved the mujahideen guerrilla militia types. That was obvious in Rambo 3. Do you remember this movie? It’s so bad, it’s good. It’s where your all-American hero goes to Afghanistan to help the heroic mujahideen against the horrible, good-for-nuthin’ Ruskies. A few years later, the real Soviet Union suddenly collapsed and the American media needed a scarecrow, and we stepped in to fill the gap. News agencies, you’re welcome!
Okay. So, as I was saying, for decades the worst and most extreme interpretation of Sharia was fueled by Saudi money and their Wahhabi ideology. America goes along with it as long as they pump out the oil as fast as they pump the hate. But to be fair, it’s not just Saudi Arabia. Many of the military regimes in the region love Sharia. You can’t drive the masses with guns and tanks forever so you need a more spiritual controlling tool: the Good God Himself.
Sadat, our president before Mubarak, changed the constitution in 1980 to give himself unlimited presidential terms. And to pass this statute he also had to make a drastic change in the constitution to appease the Muslim majority. He tweaked the Sharia article in the constitution to state that instead of “Sharia is a source of legislation,” “Sharia is the source of legislation.” It is a wonder how a couple of letters can fuck a whole country.
