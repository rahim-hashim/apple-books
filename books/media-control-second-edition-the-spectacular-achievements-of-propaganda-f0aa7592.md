THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA in contemporary politics 
forces us to ask what kind of a world and what kind 
of a society we want to live in, and in particular in 
what sense of democracy do we want this to be a 
democratic society? Let me begin by counter-posing two different conceptions of democracy. One 
conception of democracy has it that a democratic 
society is one in which the public has the means 
to participate in some meaningful way in the management of their own affairs and the means of information are open and free. If you look up democracy 
in the dictionary you'll get a definition something 
like that.
An alternative conception of democracy is that the 
public must be barred from managing of their own 
affairs and the means of information must be kept 
narrowly and rigidly controlled. That may sound like 
an odd conception of democracy, but it's important 
to understand that it is the prevailing conception. In 
fact, it has long been, not just in operation, but even 
in theory. 

Let's begin with the first modern government propaganda operation. That was under the Woodrow 
Wilson Administration. Woodrow Wilson was 
elected President in 1916 on the platform "Peace 
Without Victory." That was right in the middle of 
the World War I. The population was extremely 
pacifistic and saw no reason to become involved in 
a European war. The Wilson administration was 
actually committed to war and had to do something 
about it. They established a government propaganda 
commission, called the Creel Commission, which 
succeeded, within six months, in turning a pacifist 
population into a hysterical, war-mongering popu lation which wanted to destroy everything German, 
tear the Germans limb from limb, go to war and save 
the world. That was a major achievement, and it led 
to a further achievement. Right at that time and 
after the war the same techniques were used to whip 
up a hysterical Red Scare, as it was called, which 
succeeded pretty much in destroying unions and 
eliminating such dangerous problems as freedom of 
the press and freedom of political thought. There 
was very strong support from the media, from the 
business establishment, which in fact organized, 
pushed much of this work, and it was, in general, a 
great success.


State propaganda, when supported by the educated 
classes and when no deviation is permitted from it, 
can have a big effect.

Maybe there will be a popular revolution, and 
that will put us into state power; or maybe there 
won't be, in which case we'll just work for the people with real power: the business community. But 
we'll do the same thing. We'll drive the stupid 
masses toward a world that they're too dumb to 
understand for themselves.

In the 1930s, big problems 
arose again, as they had during the First World War. 
There was a huge depression and substantial labor 
organizing. In fact, in 1935 labor won its first major 
legislative victory, namely, the right to organize, with 
the Wagner Act. That raised two serious problems. 
For one thing, democracy was misfunctioning. The 
bewildered herd was actually winning legislative victories, and it's not supposed to work that way. The 
other problem was that it was becoming possible for 
people to organize. People have to be atomized and 
segregated and alone. They're not supposed to organize, because then they might be something beyond 
spectators of action. They might actually be participants if many people with limited resources could get 
together to enter the political arena. That's really 
threatening. A major response was taken on the part 
of business to ensure that this would be the last legislative victory for labor and that it would be the 
beginning of the end of this democratic deviation of 
popular organization. It worked. That was the last legislative victory for labor. From that point 
on-although the number of people in the unions 
increased for a while during the World War II, after which it started dropping-the capacity to act 
through the unions began to steadily drop.

In fact, 
going back to the business community, the last legal 
victory for labor really was 1935, the Wagner Act. 
After the war came, the unions declined as did a 
very rich working class culture that was associated 
with the unions. That was destroyed. We moved to 
a business-run society at a remarkable level. This 
is the only state-capitalist industrial society which 
doesn't have even the normal social contract that 
you find in comparable societies. Outside of South 
Africa, I guess, this is the only industrial society 
that doesn't have national health care. There's no 
general commitment to even minimal standards of 
survival for the parts of the population who can't follow those rules and gain things for themselves 
individually. Unions are virtually nonexistent. 
Other forms of popular structure are virtually 
nonexistent. There are no political parties or organizations. It's a long way toward the ideal, at least 
structurally. The media are a corporate monopoly. 
They have the same point of view. The two parties 
are two factions of the business party. Most of the 
population doesn't even bother voting because it 
looks meaningless. They're marginalized and properly distracted.

Prior to about the mid-1980s, 
when you were asleep you would just play the 
record: the Russians are coming. But he lost that one 
and he's got to make up new ones, just like the Reaganite public relations apparatus did in the 1980s. 
So it was international terrorists and narcotraffickers and crazed Arabs and Saddam Hussein, 
the new Hitler, was going to conquer the world. 
They've got to keep coming up one after another. 
You frighten the population, terrorize them, intimidate them so that they're too afraid to travel and 
cower in fear. Then you have a magnificent victory 
over Grenada, Panama, or some other defenseless 
third-world army that you can pulverize before you 
ever bother to look at them-which is just what happened. That gives relief. We were saved at the last 
minute. That's one of the ways in which you can 
keep the bewildered herd from paying attention to 
what's really going on around them, keep them 
diverted and controlled.
