In her three decades as a journalist, as the headlines seemed to grow

ever more grim, Deborah had
            seen the words shed their weight a little more with each occurrence, until they barely resembled the dense nouns and heavy
            adjectives that once pressed upon entire rooms. But that was the only way to continue working, Nina thought, to shield your
            soul from breaking.

It was quite a complex issue—Nina’s magazine had just covered
            the trend—since these short-stringers were seemingly healthy, their actions still illegal. But did they not share the same
            rights as the terminally ill? Maura wondered. The chance to exert their power, their freedom, in the final hour of their life?

I see what Congressman Rollins
            and our current administration are doing—forcing members of certain professions to look at their strings when they had chosen
            not to, questioning people’s ability to serve their country, and treating people differently based on a mere accident of fate.
            But I believe in the freedom of choice. I believe in equality. The civil rights activists and women’s rights activists and gay
            rights activists have all been fighting this fight for generations. And while those of us with short strings may not measure
            as large in number as those communities, we are not insignificant. And we will not stop fighting, either.”

I think we’re raised to believe that happiness is something we’ve been promised. That we all deserve to be happy. Which is
               why this really fucked-up thing that’s happening to some of us is so hard to accept. Because we’re supposed to be happy. But
               then this box arrived at our doorstep, saying that we don’t get the same happy ending as the people we pass on the sidewalk,
               at the movies, at the grocery store. They get to keep on living, and we don’t, and there’s just no reason why.

“Before the strings arrived, that was the chance anyone took when they got married, or when they had kids. There was no guarantee. But you still vowed in sickness and in health,
            not knowing which one you’d get, and you still promised till death do us part, with no idea when that parting would occur.”
            Nina paused. “But now that we have the strings, suddenly the risk that every couple used to accept has become so unimaginable?”
