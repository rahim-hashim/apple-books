### Chapter 2: The Pie Chart

the middle class finds it harder to afford any type of private education, even religious schools, which tend to cost less than some nonsectarian schools. With the falloff of attendance at private Catholic schools over the last several decades, which once catered to middle-income students, the students at private schools are increasingly from one class: the very affluent. These pools of privilege create what Reardon refers to as an “empathy gap” among affluent children for members of other socioeconomic classes. As the researchers point out, income inequality and racial inequality go hand in hand, and affluent children are often educated without a great deal of interaction with members of other socioeconomic and racial groups. Private schools, even while they try to dispense financial aid to attract a more diverse student body, are still the domain of the wealthy—and the white.

A study conducted by Raj Chetty and colleagues at Stanford (where he then taught) found that when kids grow up, their income is highly correlated with that of their parents, and the income of the top 1 percent skyrockets even from the income of those at the 97th percentile. In other words, if your parents were at the 97th percentile of income (or the top 3 percent), you are likely to earn around $60,000 as an adult, but this amount jumps to $80,000 for those raised in the top 1 percent. (This is a national figure, and the 1 percent in New York are much wealthier.) The children of those at the top are more likely to be employed (except those at the very top, who may not need to work, thanks to trust funds), and they are more likely to go to college.

### Chapter 4: Hothouse Flowers

 I discover from speaking to the admissions staff at the school where I work that there are feeder schools for kindergarten. To get a leg up, you first have to start your kid at Park Avenue Christian Church Day School (which later moved to the West Side, dropping the Avenue, among other words) or some similarly pricey and exclusive school. Kids are interviewed for kindergarten.

It’s complicated figuring out why Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (HYP in admissions parlance) mean so much to rich parents. For poor parents, admission to this type of college means a path to a totally different life for one’s child. For rich parents, it’s more about wanting a return on investment—all the time and resources they put into their kids will have paid off if they lead to this type of college. And of course, in this era, when people post their college-admission results on social media, it is sweet to have bragging rights to an HYP admission. It’s likely the same reason people take pictures of the entrées in their pricey restaurant dinner and post them online. They want to make other people envious.

### Chapter 6: The Lost Papers

I am fired by an Upper West Side mother after her daughter thoroughly prepares for a science test and then fails it. She uses multiple ways to learn the material and definitely knows it, but when she enters the test room, it leaves her head like a bird in flight. I am perplexed and unnerved by her daughter’s constant failures when she seems to be so well prepared, and nothing in her neuropsychological evaluation explains why this eighth grader should lose hold of material that she has overlearned. I’m hoping that her mother will see this as another clue that can help us put together the puzzle, but the learning specialist at the school, who has met with the family already, informs me, “They didn’t have very nice things to say about you,” so I’m not surprised when they let me go.

### Chapter 7: Stolen Moments

I have never understood why the children of the affluent—at least, some of them—are not allowed to chart their own course through life. Why are they not allowed free time? Their own choice of career? Why is every moment guarded? Many of them will have the freedom—and money—to choose, in theory, any path they want, but they are instead steered toward a limited roster of choices. In these kids’ lives, every moment is transactional, leading to money-making careers or, in the case of many of the women, to money-making careers that lead to marrying people who will have money-making careers.
