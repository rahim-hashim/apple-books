### Photographic plates from Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872)

Expression was written when Darwin was about sixty-three years old, after several other landmark books, including The Voyage of the Beagle (more properly titled The Journal of Researches, 1839) and On the Origin of Species (1859). The notebooks, however, were begun much earlier. Darwin began notebook “M” in 1838, just before the publication of the Voyage of the Beagle. “N,” which he started when “M” was full, began in 1856, three years before the publication of Origin of Species. In other words, Darwin began thinking about emotional expression early in his career, long before publishing his famous theories of evolution. As the notebooks show, the questions Darwin addressed in Expression nagged at him for at least thirty-four years.
