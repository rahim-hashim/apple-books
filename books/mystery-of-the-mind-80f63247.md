### Introduction: The Only True Voyage

There is a wonderful word for this sensory bubble—Umwelt. It was defined and popularized by the Baltic-German zoologist Jakob von Uexküll in 1909. Umwelt comes from the German word for “environment,” but Uexküll didn’t use it simply to refer to an animal’s surroundings. Instead, an Umwelt is specifically the part of those surroundings that an animal can sense and experience—its perceptual world.

Consider the seemingly simple question How many senses are there? Around 2,370 years ago, Aristotle wrote that there are five, in both humans and other animals—sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This tally persists today. But according to the philosopher Fiona Macpherson, there are reasons to doubt it. For a start, Aristotle missed a few in humans: proprioception, the awareness of your own body, which is distinct from touch; and equilibrioception, the sense of balance, which has links to both touch and vision.
			Other animals have senses that are even harder to categorize.

### Chapter 1: Sherringtonian Alternatives—Two Fundamental Elements or Only One?

In the end, [Charles Sherrington] could only say that "we have to regard the relation of mind to brain as still not merely unsolved, but still devoid of a basis for its very beginning."

Can the brain explain man? Can the brain achieve by neuronal action all that the mind accomplishes?

### Chapter 2: To Consciousness the Brain Is Messenger

Hippocrates left behind him only a single discussion of the function of the brain and the nature of consciousness. It was included in a lecture delivered to an audience of medical men on epilepsia, the affliction that we still call epilepsy. Here is an excerpt from this lecture, this amazing flash of understanding: "Some people say that the heart is the organ with which we think and that it feels pain and anxiety. But it is not so. Men ought to know from the brain and from the brain only arise our pleasures, joys, laughters, and tears. Through it, in particular, we think, see, hear and distinguish the ugly from the beautiful, the bad from the good, the pleasant from the unpleasant...To consciousness the brain is messenger"
