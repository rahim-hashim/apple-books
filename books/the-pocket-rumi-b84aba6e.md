THE RUINS OF THE HEART
I am a sculptor, a molder of form.
In every moment I shape an idol.
But then, in front of you, I melt them down.
I can rouse a hundred forms
and fill them with spirit,
but when I look into your face,
I want to throw them in the fire.
Do you merely fill this drunkard’s glass,
or do you really oppose the sober?
Is it you who brings to ruin
every house I build?
My soul spills into yours and is blended.
Because my soul has absorbed your fragrance,
I cherish it.
Every drop of blood I spill
informs the earth,
“I merge with my Beloved
when I participate in love.”
In this house of mud and water,
my heart has fallen into ruins.
Enter this house, my Love, or let me leave.

THE DRUNKARDS AND THE TAVERN
I’m drunk and you’re insane,
who’s going to take us home?

INTELLECT IS A SHACKLE
O my child, intellect is a shackle
on the foot of one who walks the Path.
Break the bond; the Way is open!
The intellect is a chain, the heart may be deceptive,
and even your soul is a veil—
the Path is hidden from all three.
When you lift the intellect, soul, and heart,
the station of nearness you reach is still subjective.
One who gets lost isn’t considered brave.
Love takes aim at the one who has no troubles.
Know that the arrow of the Friend is ready in the bow.
Make your chest a target in front of it.
Love isn’t the work of the tender and the gentle;
Love is the work of wrestlers.
The one who becomes a servant of lovers
is really a fortunate sovereign.
Don’t ask anyone about Love;
ask Love alone about Love.
Love is a cloud that scatters pearls.
Love doesn’t need me to translate; it translates for itself.
If you journey to the seventh heaven,
Love is a useful ladder.
Wherever a caravan journeys, Love is its qiblah5
May this universe not deceive you,
waylaying you from Love,
for this universe comes from you.
Let’s go! Close your mouth like mother of pearl.
Be silent, for this tongue of yours
is the enemy of the soul.
O child, Shams of Tabriz has arrived;
the soul is full of joy
for the time has come to join in union with his sun.

WOMAN IS A RAY OF GOD
Muhammad said,
“Woman prevails over the wise and intelligent;
while the ignorant dominate over her.”
They lack tenderness and affection
because their animality prevails.
Love and gentleness are human qualities;
aggressiveness and lust are bestial.
Woman is a ray of God.
She is not that earthly beloved.
You could say:
she is creative, not created.

APPRENTICESHIP
If anybody goes traveling without a guide,
every two days’ journey
becomes a journey of a hundred years.
The one who takes up a profession
without having had a teacher
becomes a laughingstock,
no matter where he lives.
Except perhaps for a single occurrence,
in all the world, is a descendant of Adam
ever born without parents?
The one who earns gains wealth;
it’s a rare event
to find a buried treasure.


BEYOND APPEARANCES
Everyone can distinguish mercy from wrath,
whether he is wise or ignorant or corrupt,
but a mercy hidden in wrath,
or wrath hidden in the heart of mercy
can only be recognized by one whose heart
contains a spiritual touchstone.
MATHNAWI III, 1506–08

HOW HAVE YOU SPENT YOUR LIFE?
On Resurrection Day God will ask,
“During this reprieve I gave you,
what have you produced for Me?
Through what work have you reached your life’s end?
For what end have your food
and your strength been consumed?
Where have you dimmed the luster of your eye?
Where have you dissipated your five senses?
You have spent your seeing, hearing, intelligence
and the pure celestial substances;
what have you purchased from the earth?
I gave you hands and feet as spade and mattock
for tilling the soil of good works;
when did they by themselves become existent?”


THE GUEST HOUSE
Darling, the body is a guest house;
every morning someone new arrives.
Don’t say, “O, another weight around my neck!”
or your guest will fly back to nothingness.
Whatever enters your heart is a guest
from the invisible world: entertain it well.
Every day and every moment a thought comes
like an honored guest into your heart.
My soul, regard each thought as a person,
for every person’s true value
is in the quality of thought they hold.
If a sorrowful thought stands in the way,
it is also preparing the way for joy.
It furiously sweeps your house clean,
in order that some new joy
may appear from the Source.
It scatters the withered leaves
from the bough of the heart,
in order that fresh green leaves might grow.
It uproots the old joy so that
a new joy may enter from Beyond.
Sorrow pulls up the rotten root
that was hidden from sight.
Whatever sorrow takes away
or causes the heart to sacrifice,
it puts something better in its place—
especially for one who is certain
that sorrow is the servant of the intuitive.
Without the frown of clouds and lightning,
the vines would be burned by the smiling sun.
Both good and bad luck
become guests in your heart:
like planets traveling from sign to sign.
When something transits your sign,
adapt yourself,
and be as harmonious as its ruling sign,
so that when it rejoins the Moon,
it will speak kindly to the Lord of the heart.
Whenever sorrows comes again,
meet it with smiles and laughter,
saying, “O my Creator, save me from its harm:
and do not deprive me of its good.
Lord, remind me to be thankful,
let me feel no regret if its benefit passes away.
“And if the pearl is not in sorrow’s hand,
let it go and still be pleased.
Increase your sweet practice.
Your practice will benefit you at another time;
someday your need will be suddenly fulfilled.”
Kabir Helminski
