What makes this gap particularly frustrating is that there seems to be no comparable slowdown in scientific discovery. If anything, the frontiers of science in biotechnology are progressing at an exponential rate. One crude measure is the growth in the number of research biotech patents filed: 3,056 in 2011 versus 4,257 in 2015.7 Another measure is the number of publicly available DNA sequences of genes, compiled by the NIH’s GenBank database.8 In 1982, there were a grand total of 606 genetic sequences available to the public, which might fill a small book. By February 2016, there were over 190 million DNA sequences, a vast library of genetic information doubling in size every twenty-one months—and GenBank is already being outcompeted by its successor, the Whole Genome Shotgun project. (The “shotgun” refers to the blast method of DNA sequencing involved.) Our knowledge of how these genes translate into human traits and biological functions has also been growing, to the point where we can now not only identify the genes that cause certain deadly diseases, but we can fix them like correcting typos in a manuscript.
But the valley of death, as well the cyclical nature of biotech venture capital and the public equity markets, can’t keep up with this amazing growth in biomedical knowledge. As a result, it’s becoming harder and harder to translate new research into useful treatments for our most pressing medical needs. Why?
