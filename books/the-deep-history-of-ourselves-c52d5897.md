An organism is a living thing, an entity that functions as a physiological unit, the component parts of which operate with a high degree of cooperation and a low degree of conflict to help ensure well-being and sustain the life of the overall entity and to reproduce itself so that its kind can continue.
			The mission of an organism is simple: It is to acquire nutrients and energy so that growth can occur and life can be sustained to at least the point of reproduction.

The simplest form of behavior in animals is a reflex, an innate stimulus-response reaction that occurs by way of nerves that directly connect sensory input systems with muscles. Reflexes are automatically elicited by certain stimuli and are not dependent on volitional control. As a result, they are very useful in assessing such factors as neurological function in babies. Inborn reflex patterns are essential not only for early survival but throughout life. For example, they control balance and gait, and if you step on a sharp object, your foot reflexively withdraws. A sudden loud noise activates several reflexes, collectively called the startle response, causing your eyes to blink and neck to stiffen while your whole body flinches. When you eat, reflexes underlie chewing, swallowing, digestion, and waste excretion. As blood pressure rises, the beating of the heart reflexively slows to keep pressure in a safe range.
			Reflexes typically involve the response of a specific muscle group (mouth, leg, foot, eye) or a set of responses within a body system (balance, digestion, and startle). But animals also need to perform movements that involve coordination of the entire body, and some of these are, like reflexes, inborn. Pioneering ethologists such as Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen called these more complex hardwired responses fixed action patterns, but I prefer the term fixed reaction patterns, which better describes their automaticity.
			Like reflexes, fixed reaction patterns are elicited automatically by specific stimuli. But in contrast to reflexes, they unfold over time as complex sequences of behavior. Tinbergen’s most famous example is egg retrieval by a mother goose. The sight of an egg out of the nest elicits neck extension and rolling of the egg back to the nest. Another example in birds is mouth gaping in chicks triggered by beak movements of the mother just above the nest. And in male stickleback fish the sight of a red belly (signifying an intruding male) elicits fighting while the swollen belly of a female (signifying a receptive partner) initiates mating by the male. In mammals, the sight or odor of food elicits approach, while sights, sounds, and odors signifying a predator elicit freezing, fleeing, or fighting, depending on the proximity of the predator.
			Fixed reactions, not surprisingly, underlie universal survival activities, such as feeding, drinking, defense, and reproduction, and in some species, behaviors associated with parenting and social interactions as well. But the specific expression of such behaviors in a given species is unique—all animals defend, eat, and mate, but how they do so is specific to the kind of body they have. For this reason, fixed reaction patterns are considered species-typical behaviors.

The examples so far emphasize how novel stimuli come to elicit behaviors that are largely inborn. But some animals can also acquire novel behaviors through learning. If an arbitrary response, such as pressing a bar or pushing a button, is followed by a beneficial outcome (a reinforcer), it will increase the likelihood of similar behavior in the future. This effect was first described by Edward Thorndike in the late nineteenth century when he found that food-deprived cats held in a chamber became very animated when presented with food placed outside the chamber. Their random movements eventually led to their opening the door, allowing them access to the food (figure 6.2). Over the course of multiple repetitions of this, the cats learned which movement to perform to open the door. This is called instrumental learning, since the behavior is instrumental in producing the reinforcer.
