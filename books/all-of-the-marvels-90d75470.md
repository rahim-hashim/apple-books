### Chapter 1: The Mountain of Marvels

Marvel Comics, as an artistic and commercial project, began in the early 1960s, initially as the work of a handful of experienced comics professionals—artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, editor/writer Stan Lee,* and a few others. The superhero stories that had dominated American comic books in the late ’30s and early ’40s had mostly fallen out of style at that point, but instead of returning to that faltering genre as it had been, Kirby, Ditko, and Lee combined it with aspects of the genres that had supplanted it: the uncanny horror of the monster and sci-fi stories

recently; the focus on the emotion of the romance anthologies Kirby had helped to invent in 1947; the gently jabbing wit of the humor titles Lee had been writing for many years

### Chapter 4: The Junction to Everywhere

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby’s 1961–1970 run on Fantastic Four was the first superhero series Marvel published in that era, and effectively the flagship comic of the line

### Chapter 6: Spinning in Circles

playboy or supernatural royalty. He’s a lonely, bitter teenage bookworm, a would-be scientist and inventor whose accidental acquisition of a bug’s powers ruins his life. The story’s final images are of Spider-Man sobbing in horror and shame at his failure. That was something new.

The closing line of Lee’s narration—“with great power there must also come great responsibility”—has become an endlessly repeated and misquoted catchphrase, but the constant tension between what Spider-Man wants to do and what he forces himself to do is what makes him who he is.

### Chapter 7: Interlude: Lee, Kirby, Ditko

Before digital workflows became common in the late 1990s, the order of operations for mainstream comics usually began with a writer, who would write a full script describing the action in each panel, along with dialogue and captions. A 

penciler would then draw it in pencil; a letterer would write in the text; an inker would finalize the drawings with ink lines;* a colorist would indicate which hues went where; and then it would be printed on a four-color printing press.
Marvel did things a bit differently. In the early 1960s, Lee developed what he later called the “Marvel method”: instead of writing a script at the outset, he would write a loose plot for whichever artist was going to draw a particular story (or act it out for them, or chat with them about a few ideas he’d like to see realized, or very often just leave it up to them altogether), then add dialogue and captions to the artwork at the pencil stage. That saved Lee a lot of time, and gave pencilers a lot more creative latitude to tell a story visually—or a lot more unpaid work to do, depending on your perspective.* The “Marvel method” meant that Lee made his contributions to plots in his capacity as an editor, and sometimes he didn’t have to.

Even so, it’s hard to dispute that Kirby and Ditko, like most of Marvel’s artists between 1961 and 1971, had their biggest creative breakthroughs while working with Lee. From the way Lee’s collaborators talked about him later on, you’d think he was half a dozen different people: the man who plucked them from obscurity and put their name in lights, who stole the glory that was rightfully theirs, who misconstrued and muffled their voices, who polished their work until it shined and sang

### Chapter 10: The Mutant Metaphor

often had greater artistic triumphs, but from 1978 to 1987, X-Men was the bestselling American comic 

book series, and its readership increased every year. Over the course of that decade, its average monthly sales grew from about 116,000 copies an issue to more than 430,000, now an unthinkably huge figure.

Claremont’s writing, conversely, is all fantastic tics. He focuses on characters’ particular drives, their personal linguistic quirks, their hidden dimensions, their unconscious urges. He sets 

stories in interesting places around the world, real and invented. He lets his characters splash around in the pools of their emotions, exploring their feelings at length in dialogue or thought balloons. Then he explains in garrulous captions whatever won’t fit into their mouths or minds. He scatters potential plot threads everywhere, picking them up later, or not, at his convenience. If Byrne draws a pistol on a wall, it will be fired by the end of the issue; if Claremont has a character mention a pistol on a wall, it might never be mentioned again, or it might turn out, sixty issues later, to have been cursed by an eighteenth-century warlock.

The Claremont-Byrne team’s smartest innovation on X-Men was that they began to take proper advantage of the metaphor that had been built into the series all along: mutants as the despised and oppressed Other. The X-Men are “feared and hated by the world they have sworn to protect,” the world of Homo sapiens. That hate and fear is directed toward them as a group and binds them as a group. What either the X-Men or their enemies do is inseparable in the public eye from what mutants do.

The particular genius of that metaphor is that it applies to a whole lot of people in a very general way—enough to permit readers’ identification with the X-Men as a group—without applying completely and directly to anyone. And its sly corollary is that mutants’ oppressors are humans, a group to which every reader (and creator) of X-Men comics does belong; violence against mutants is committed by us, or at least in our name.

The mutant metaphor applies a bit more directly to sexuality—if you’re a mutant, you’re born that way, although your difference/gift might not reveal itself until puberty or thereabouts—even if it’s still not entirely on the mark. LGBTQ readers have embraced X-Men like few other comics, although its plots have often hinged on straight romances. It definitely has more characters who are canonically not cis-hetero than most superhero comics, if still relatively few of them.

X-Men is a history of a (fictional) community with a shared identity, seen through a small cross-section of the group that’s heterogeneous in every other way.

More broadly, though, X-Men’s divisions between mutants are generally shown as less important than solidarity among them. Almost no (mutant) villain is entirely irredeemable, no matter how terrible their actions in the past have been (by 1986, Magneto is running the Xavier School, for instance). Almost no hero is entirely incorruptible, or doesn’t have some blood on their hands

### Chapter 14: What Kings Do

Coates is also, however, a longtime comics nerd who has spent the better part of his life thinking about political power, and his five-year stretch as Black Panther’s writer was an immediate hit. Its opening image is, once again, a flashback to T’Challa on his knees as his father tells him, “You are no longer my son.” T’Challa had returned to the Wakandan throne by this point, but the central question of Coates’s story addresses a problem that had been conveniently overlooked for fifty years’ worth of Black Panther stories: Why would Wakanda, the most advanced nation in the world, have a hereditary monarchy as its seat of power in the first place?

Hudlin’s idea that Wakanda might someday rule over everything is appealing, but universal rule is only a utopia for the rulers. The most recent Black Panther series is again written by Coates and refracts that concept through the lens of the most familiar pop-culture narrative about colonialism: Star Wars’s rebels-versus-empire setup. Subtitled “The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda,” it’s apparently set thousands of years in the future. Its oppressive, star-spanning imperial power is led by an emperor named N’Jadaka (the Wakandan name of Killmonger), and the rule-flouting guerrilla warrior who’s the hero of its slave rebellion is named T’Challa.

### Chapter 16: The Iron Patriot Acts

The best work of fiction I’ve seen about life under the Donald Trump administration—the one that most accurately captures the slow-grinding despair and tension of that period in American culture—is “Dark Reign,” which spans roughly three hundred issues that Marvel Comics published during the first year of the Barack Obama administration. Its cornerstone episode, Dark Avengers #1, came out January 21, 2009, the day after Obama’s inauguration.
“Dark Reign” is the story of what happens after a genuinely malign individual ascends to political power and empowers his cronies to do what they will. The character in question is Norman Osborn, the sociopathic businessman who had first appeared as Spider-Man’s nemesis the Green Goblin in the mid-1960s. For the entirety of 2009, he and his allies were everywhere, and nearly every Marvel series set in the present day on Earth became, to one extent or another, about survival in the time of Osborn.
More broadly, “Dark Reign” is about the way totalitarian regimes gain and keep power. They focus attention on a crisis, real or invented; they present a charismatic leader’s harsh solutions as the only effective answer. As soon as they’ve attained power, they consolidate state forces under their control, undermine trust in the institutions that would ordinarily act as checks on them, and form covert alliances to defang or destroy resistance—all of which Osborn does.
Marvel didn’t publish any comic book called, simply, Dark Reign, although there were a bunch that had “Dark Reign” in their titles.* The story has no central narrative, just an overwhelming, fluctuating political atmosphere permeating comics published between December 2008 and December 2009, bookended by two more traditionally structured event comics: Secret Invasion, which ran through most of 2008, and Siege, which unfolded over the initial third of 2010. And its form—dozens of intersecting threads all moving from a shared starting point to a shared destination—is the sort of thing that can really only be pulled off in the context of corporate-owned mainstream comics.

### Chapter 20: Good Is a Thing You Do

In Marvel’s early years, American youth were worried about crime, and Communism, and having their secrets revealed. Now they care about social injustice, and systemic oppression and corruption, and having their voices ignored and their identities erased.
