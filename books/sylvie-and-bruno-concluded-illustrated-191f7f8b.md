Mein Herr looked from one to the other in
blank astonishment. “I do not understand
you,” he said. “I had lost my way, and I was
consulting a pocket-map, and somehow I had
dropped one of my gloves, and this invisible
Something, that had rubbed against my knee,
actually brought it back to me!”
“Course he did!” said Bruno. “He’s
welly fond of fetching things.”

Mein Herr looked so thoroughly bewildered
that I thought it best to change the subject.
“What a useful thing a pocket-map is!” I
remarked.
“That’s another thing we’ve learned from
your Nation,” said Mein Herr, “map-making.
But we’ve carried it much further than you.
What do you consider the largest map that
would be really useful?”
“About six inches to the mile.”
“Only six inches!” exclaimed Mein Herr.
“We very soon got to six yards to the mile.
Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile.
And then came the grandest idea of all! We
actually made a map of the country, on the
scale of a mile to the mile!”
“Have you used it much?” I enquired.
“It has never been spread out, yet,” said
Mein Herr: “the farmers objected: they said
it would cover the whole country, and shut out
the sunlight! So we now use the country itself,
as its own map, and I assure you it does
nearly as well. Now let me ask you another
question. What is the smallest world you
would care to inhabit?”

“I know!” cried Bruno, who was listening
intently. “I’d like a little teeny-tiny world,
just big enough for Sylvie and me!”
“Then you would have to stand on opposite
sides of it,” said Mein Herr. “And so you
would never see your sister at all!”
“And I’d have no lessons,” said Bruno.
“You don’t mean to say you’ve been trying
experiments in that direction!” I said.
“Well, not experiments exactly. We do not
profess to construct planets. But a scientific
friend of mine, who has made several balloon-voyages,
assures me he has visited a planet so
small that he could walk right round it in
twenty minutes! There had been a great
battle, just before his visit, which had ended
rather oddly: the vanquished army ran away
at full speed, and in a very few minutes found
themselves face-to-face with the victorious
army, who were marching home again, and
who were so frightened at finding themselves
between two armies, that they surrendered at
once! Of course that lost them the battle,
though, as a matter of fact, they had killed all
the soldiers on the other side.”
